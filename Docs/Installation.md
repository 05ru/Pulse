# Installation

Pulse is distributed as a binary framework using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

Go to **File / Swift Packages / Add Package Dependency...** and enter package repository URL **https://github.com/kean/PulseUI** (requires access), then follow the instructions.

To remove the dependency, select the project and open **Swift Packages** (which is next to **Build Settings**). You can add and remove packages from this tab.

> Swift Package Manager can also be used [from the command line](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

After adding a package, make sure to add all suggested products to your project.
